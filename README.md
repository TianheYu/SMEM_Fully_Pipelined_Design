# SMEM_Fully_Pipelined_Design
SMEM++, A Fully Pipelined and Time-Multiplexed SMEM Seeding Accelerator for Genome Sequencing

This released code is the SMEM FPGA kernel code, the details of which is described in our paper. The original implementation is on harp2 and has copyright issues so the FPGA side communication interface code is abbreviated. It should be fairly easy to port this code to your platform if features a 512bitwidth read/write port.
You can find our paper within this same repository. 

Please cite our paper if you are inspired by our design.
